This is an internship project. You can drag and drop one or multiple photos and videos in the media box and they will arrange themselves. A thumbnail will be created for all the media files. You can drag and drop from the media box to the memory box to display a media file. You can drag and and remove the current media file from the memory box. Click the reset button to reset, pretty basic.
